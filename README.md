This repository contains all necessary stuff to deploy discovery-api in the 5GMETA Cloud platform.

This API is in charge of managing all neccessary information about MECs and their capabilities, coverage zones (tiles) and services provided by them to 3rd party applications and to 5GMETA platform members.

# Requisites

This API has to be deployed in a Kubernetes running environment. 

It needs access to:
 - a sql database called dataflowdb defined by [https://github.com/5gmeta/dataflow_cloud/blob/main/src/mysql/dataflow_DB_CLOUD_mysql.sql](https://github.com/5gmeta/dataflow_cloud/blob/main/src/mysql/dataflow_DB_CLOUD_mysql.sql) and
 - a database discoverydb defined by [https://github.com/5gmeta/discovery/blob/main/src/data/sql/database.sql](https://github.com/5gmeta/discovery/blob/main/src/data/sql/database.sql). 

Please refer to [https://github.com/5gmeta/platform-config/blob/main/docs/cloud-database.md](https://github.com/5gmeta/platform-config/blob/main/docs/cloud-database.md) to get more information about database deployment.


# Source code

Source code can be found on [/src/python-flask-server-generated](/src/python-flask-server-generated)

# Building image

Go to [/src/python-flask-server-generated](/src/python-flask-server-generated):

```
docker build -t swagger_server .
```

Please refer to  [/src/python-flask-server-generated/README.md](/src/python-flask-server-generated/README.md) to get more information about building.

# Deployment

Deployment of discovery API in the production environment has to be made by deploying the helmchart defined on [https://github.com/5gmeta/helmcharts/tree/main/charts/discoveryapi-chart](https://github.com/5gmeta/helmcharts/tree/main/charts/discoveryapi-chart) 

To do this please follow instructions from [https://github.com/5gmeta/platform-config/blob/main/docs/cloud-modules-deployment.md](https://github.com/5gmeta/platform-config/blob/main/docs/cloud-modules-deployment.md).

# Examples

Some usage examples can be found in [examples](examples) folder. Please refer to [examples/README.md](examples/README.md)

# Interactions 

The different functions provided are depicted in different diagrams:

## Get MECID containing a Tile

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    MEC->>+Discovery: GET /mecregistry/{tile}
    Discovery-->>+MEC: 200 OK MECID
```

## Register a new MEC

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    MEC->>+Discovery: POST /mecregistry (MEC description JSON)
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK MECID
    MEC->>+Discovery: POST /mecregistry/{MECID}/tile/{tile}
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK
```

## Register northbound services into a MEC

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    MEC->>+Discovery: POST /mecregistry/{MECID}/nbservices (JSON northbound services description)
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK
    opt optional
    MEC->>+Discovery: PATCH /mecregistry/{MECID}/nbservices{service_id} (JSON northbound services description)
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK
    end
```

## Get northbound from MEC

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    MEC->>+Discovery: GET /mecregistry/{MECID}/nbservices 
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK (JSON nortbound services)
	opt optional
	MEC->>+Discovery: GET /mecregistry/{MECID}/nbservices{service_id}
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK (JSON nortbound service)
	end
```

## Get northbound services from given MEC



## Delete a MEC

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    MEC->>+Discovery: DELETE /mecregistry/{MECID}/tile/{tile}
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK
    MEC->>+Discovery: DELETE /mecregistry/{MECID}
    Discovery-->>MEC: 200 OK
```
